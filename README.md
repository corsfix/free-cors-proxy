# Corsfix Open Source Sponsorship

This repository contains a list of websites that are sponsored through [corsfix.com](https://corsfix.com), providing CORS proxy services for various domains.

## How It Works

The `index.js` file maintains a mapping of sponsored websites and their allowed CORS domains. Each entry consists of a website and an array of domains that they're permitted to access through the CORS proxy.

## Adding Your Website

To add your website to the sponsorship program:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your website and required domains to `index.js` following the existing format
3. Create a pull request. Once approved, your website will be added to the proxy allowlist.
